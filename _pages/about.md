I'm a last year Computer Science student at La Salle URL in Barcelona. Last year I had the chance to start working hand to hand with a PhD candidate on quantum computing and quantum machine learning in the context of a project in the Software Engineering research group at La Salle. We are researching and working on different quantum machine learning algorithms.

In parallel, I'm also broadening my knowledge in data science and deep learning. I enjoy applying what I learn in personal projects and collaborating in research groups, as I find the mix of academic research and hands-on implementation truly enriching. My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new ideas and refine my skills in machine learning, with a special focus on how these models can be applied in real-world scenarios.

In addition to my technical work, I'm passionate about sharing my findings and insights through tutorials and blog posts. I believe that explaining what I learn is a great way to reinforce my understanding and help others in their own learning journeys.

When I'm not immersed in code or data, you can usually find me out in nature, exploring trails and training for mountain races. It's my way of finding balance and recharging my creativity.
