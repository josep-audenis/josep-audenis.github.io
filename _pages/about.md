I am a final-year Computer Engineering student at La Salle URL in Barcelona, focused on machine learning and deep learning as rigorous, optimization-driven disciplines. My main interests lie in understanding model behavior, training dynamics, and efficiency constraints, rather than treating ML as a purely application-level toolkit.

I am currently beginning my Bachelor’s thesis in collaboration with the LHCb experiment at CERN, where I work on improving the classification performance of inclusive flavor tagging under strict computational and inference constraints. While my exposure to particle physics is recent, the project strongly aligns with my interests in large-scale machine learning, efficiency-aware learning, and optimization trade-offs.

In parallel, I work as a Data Scientist intern at Accenture, where I am involved in the development and deployment of generative AI solutions. My work focuses on large language models and retrieval-augmented generation systems, exposing me to real-world constraints related to scalability, robustness, and system design beyond experimental settings.

Previously, I gained early research experience in quantum computing and quantum machine learning by working closely with a PhD candidate within the Software Engineering research group at La Salle. This role involved studying and implementing quantum machine learning algorithms and strengthened my ability to engage with unfamiliar theoretical frameworks in a research-oriented environment.

Beyond formal academic and professional work, I actively pursue independent projects and structured literature reviews in machine learning, deep learning, and optimization. These projects include neuroevolution-based methods, predictive modeling for Formula 1 outcomes, and optimization approaches to supply chain problems. I document part of this work through technical notes and blog posts as a way to consolidate my understanding and share insights with others.

Outside of technical work, I spend much of my time in nature, training for mountain and trail races. This balance helps me maintain long-term discipline, focus, and creativity in both research and learning.
